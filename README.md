# ngc-range implementation

`ngc-range`: custom component that allows you to select values from a range (like a slider).

The solution has three main components:

 - ngc-range: Component with two modes: normal range from min to max and fixed number of options range.
 - Exercise1: `http://localhost:4200/exercise1` shows an example of a normal range case.
 - Exercise2: `http://localhost:4200/exercise2` shows an example of a fixed value range case.
